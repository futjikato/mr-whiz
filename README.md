# Mr. Whiz ( Final name may differ )

A small 2D Jump n' Run game written in java.
This project is currently at its development start.

## Build Mr.Whiz

You can build and run the application with [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).<br>
Use the build.xml from the root folder.<br>
Note that at this point the UI does not work. I have to figure out how get the paths right so after the build
the theme files are found.
